# Python projects for Structural and Project Engineering

This repository contains three Python scripts that provide tools for structural analysis and budget estimation

## IPE_HEA_HEB_beam_bending_moment_resistance.py:
This script allows you to calculate the bending moment resistance of IPE, HEA, and HEB beams.
It provides valuable insights into the structural strength of these beams and aids in design decisions.

## Rack_safety_backstop_structural_analysis_according_to_FEM_9.842.py:
This script performs a structural analysis of rack safety backstops based on the FEM 9.842 standard.
It helps assess the safety and stability of backstops in rack systems, providing crucial information for warehouse design.

## Steel_Structure_Budget_Assistant_Automation_for_Highbays_and_Pallet_Racks.py:
This script automates the budget estimation process for highbay and pallet rack systems.
It takes various parameters into account, such as beam types, bracing levels, single and double racks, and calculates the number of beams, frames, connectors, and other components required.
